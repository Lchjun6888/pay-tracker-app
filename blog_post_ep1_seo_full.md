### "Hyung-nim, when is the money coming in?"

This single question echoes on every construction site and led me to build a **simple payroll app** for everyone. It’s not just a question; it’s a plea, a worry, and sometimes, a resignation.

My journey with **PayTrack** didn't start in a fancy Gangnam office...

...

I searched the App Store. There were plenty of finance apps.
*   **Bank Apps?** Good for checking balance, useless for tracking *expected* income.
*   **Accounting Apps?** Too complex. Double-entry bookkeeping? A daily laborer or part-timer doesn't have time for that.
*   **Calendar Apps?** Good for schedules, but they don't calculate tax, overtime, or freelance deposits automatically.

We needed something different. Something **rugged** yet **smart**.
We needed a **simple payroll app** that was as reliable as a hammer...

...

### The Decision: "I Will Build It Myself"

I realized that complaints won't fix the industry. **Code will.**
If existing tools are too complex or too fragile, then I must build the tool that fits our reality.

So tonight, I opened my laptop.
But I'm not alone in this journey.
I have two powerful **AI Co-pilots** by my side: **Stitch** for brilliant coding solutions and **Antigravity** for architectural guidance.
Together with these AI agents, we will turn this vision into reality, faster and smarter than a traditional team.

I chose **[React](https://react.dev)** and **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)** because I need speed. I don't want a heavy app that takes minutes to load on an old phone. It has to be instant.
I chose **LocalStorage** for the first version because construction sites often have spotty signal. The data needs to live on the phone, safe and sound, regardless of the internet connection.

**Yes, I know the limitations.**
LocalStorage means no cloud sync, no automatic bank connections yet. If a user loses their phone, they lose their data.
But right now, **"Speed"** and **"Offline Access"** come first.
We can build the sophisticated backend and bank integrations later. For now, I need a tool that works in a basement with zero signal.

**The First Step**
I'm staring at a blank `App.jsx` file.
The goal is simple: Build a rugged, reliable **"Digital Logbook"** that empowers every worker to claim their rightful pay.

This is the beginning of **PayTrack**.
In the next episode, I'll share my journey of designing the UI specifically for rough, gloved hands and early morning shifts.

*(To be continued...)*

건설 현장의 일용직부터 프리랜서까지, **"기록이 없다면 돈은 언제든 안 줄 수 있고, 못 받을 수 있다."**
기존 앱들은 현장의 거친 현실에 맞지 않거나 너무 복잡했습니다.
