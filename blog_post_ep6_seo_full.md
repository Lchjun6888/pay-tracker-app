### "The Digital Bill of Rights"

PayTrack started as a shield. A way to prove you worked.
But a shield is defensive.
I want to give workers a **sword**.
A tool to actively claim what is theirs.

The current version of PayTrack is a **Passive Tracker**. It records history.
The next version, **PayTrack 2.0**, will be an **Active Financial Platform**.

### Feature 1: The "One-Touch Pay Request" 💸

Imagine this:
It's payday. The money isn't there.
Do you call the boss? Do you text him awkwardly?
*"Hello... sorry to bother you... about the payment..."*
It's stressful. It's humiliating.

**The Solution:**
PayTrack will let you generate a **Professional Digital Invoice** with one tap.
*   **Format**: "Worked 20 days. Total: 3,000,000 KRW."
*   **delivery**: Sent via KakaoTalk or SMS with a polite, automated message.
*   **Action**: The employer receives a link. They click "Approve."
*   **Result**: The money moves instantly via **Open Banking API**.

No awkward conversations. Just business.
We are standardizing the process of getting paid in the gig economy.

### Feature 2: The "Verified Worker" Badge 🏅

In the gig economy, trust is everything.
Employers worry: *"Will this freelancer ghost me?"* *"Will this daily worker show up?"*
Workers worry: *"Will this boss pay me?"*

PayTrack sits in the middle with the data to solve this.
*   **For Workers**: If you log your work consistently and get paid on time, you earn a **"Verified Sincerity" (성실 인증)** badge.
    *   This isn't just a digital sticker. It's a **Career Passport**.
    *   You can attach your PayTrack Report to your resume on **Albamon** or **Kmong**.
    *   It proves: "I show up. I work hard. I am reliable."
*   **For Employers**: We can eventually rate employers on **Payment Speed**. Good payers get access to better workers.

### Feature 3: Escrow for Freelancers (Safe Deal) 🛡️

The biggest fear for a freelancer? **Non-payment.**
The project is done. The client ghosts.
**The Solution:**
PayTrack will introduce an **Escrow Service**.
1.  **Start**: Client deposits the project fee into a safe PayTrack account.
2.  **Work**: Freelancer sees the money is safe and starts working.
3.  **Finish**: Freelancer delivers the work.
4.  **Release**: Client approves, and the money is released instantly.

This protects both sides. The client knows the work will be done. The freelancer knows the money is real.

### The Big Picture

We are moving from a "Calculator App" to a **"Financial OS for the Gig Economy."**
*   **Local Storage** -> **Cloud Database (Supabase)**: To sync data across devices.
*   **Personal Use** -> **Social Network**: Connecting workers and employers.
*   **Tracking** -> **Transactions**: Moving actual money.

This is a massive undertaking.
It requires robust backend engineering, strict security, and partnerships with banks.
But the vision is clear:
**To make every hour of work count.**
**To ensure every drop of sweat is paid for.**

This is PayTrack. And we are just getting started.

PayTrack의 최종 목표는 단순한 기록 앱이 아닙니다. 노동자가 자신의 권리를 적극적으로 행사할 수 있는 **핀테크 플랫폼**입니다.
가까운 미래에 도입될 기능들입니다:
1.  **원터치 급여 청구**: 사장님께 "돈 언제 들어오나요?"라고 묻기 힘들 때, 카카오톡으로 세련된 '디지털 청구일지'를 보낼 수 있습니다.
2.  **성실 근무 인증서**: PayTrack에 기록된 근무 내역 그 자체가 당신의 성실함을 증명하는 '경력 여권'이 됩니다.
3.  **프리랜서 에스크로**: "돈 떼이면 어쩌지?"라는 걱정 없이, 선입금 확인 후 작업을 시작하고 완료 시 즉시 정산받는 안전 거래 시스템.
